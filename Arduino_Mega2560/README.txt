1- Create a nOS directory in your Arduino libraries folder.
   ex: C:\Users\<Username>\Documents\Arduino\libraries\nOS
2- Copy all nOS source files in nOS library folder.
3- Copy all port files port/GCC/AVR folders in nOS library folder.
4- Copy nOSConfig.h from this folder in nOS library folder.
5- Open any example and try it: LED attached to pin13 should blink at 1Hz.

Should work for any ATmega based Arduino boards (Uno, Leonardo, Micro, Mega 2560, Nano, Pro Mini, ...).

Enjoy
